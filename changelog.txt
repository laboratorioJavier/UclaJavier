    - if invoked on a renamed file works like having the added/untracked and
      removed/missing file selected
    - if invoked on a submodule "file" shows same information as Changes view
  - Index Editor:
    - if Changes view is focused, the Index Editor is opened at the exact same place
    - for renamed files shows HEAD of original file
- dark theme: table header color can be set (especially on Windows)

Fixed Bugs

  - Commit: error invoking compare (by double-clicking) for added file
  - Compare: if invoked on a renamed file (pair), the original was not always shown left

    - Reveal even asked for Local vs. Tracked branch if both pointed to same commit

    modified files
- Password store: master password is reset to empty if no (more) passwords are
  present on exit

  in the preferences was unselected
